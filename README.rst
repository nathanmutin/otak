otak
====

Simple module that implements Active learning Kriging methods for reliability analysis.

Three methods are present : 

- AK-MCS : Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte-Carlo Simulation

- AK-IS : Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Importance Sampling

- AK-SS : Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Subset Simulation

These methods are built on top of OpenTURNS classes for failure probability estimation and Kriging.
